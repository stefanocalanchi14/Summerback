<!-- WHAT -->
<section class="text">
  <h2>What this is</h2>
  <p>
    Between <strong>15 May and 4 June</strong>, a house by the sea will be open to friends
    before and after Spring Attitude Festival in Rome.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s a shared base — beach days, meals, music, rest.
    People coming and going. No fixed program.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- WHEN -->
<section class="text">
  <h2>When you can come</h2>
  <p>
    You can come <strong>whenever you want</strong> within the period:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>15 May → 4 June</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Stay a few days, a week, or just pass through.
    The only requirement is to <strong>let me know in advance</strong>.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- FESTIVAL -->
<section class="text">

<!-- ROME LOGISTICS -->
<section class="text">
  <h2>Important – Rome logistics</h2>
  <p>
    I <strong>can’t host people in Rome</strong> during the festival nights.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you plan to attend <strong>both days</strong> of the festival,
    you’ll need to <strong>organize sleeping in Rome independently</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The beach house is the base <strong>before and after</strong>,
    not during the Rome nights.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- HOUSE -->
<section class="text">
  <h2>The house</h2>
  <p>
    Capacity:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>7 people</strong> very comfortably</li>
    <li><strong>11 people</strong> comfortably</li>
    <li>More is possible if we’re creative</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This works well as long as arrivals are spread out.
  </p>

  <p>
    If many of you are planning to come on similar dates,
    I need to know <strong>as soon as possible</strong> so I can arrange more space if needed.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- PLUS ONES -->
<section class="text">
  <h2>Plus ones</h2>
  <p>
    Plus ones are welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just include them when you message me so I can factor them into capacity planning.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- HOW -->
<section class="text">
  <h2>How to coordinate</h2>
  <p>
    If you’re planning to come at any point during this period, send me:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Approximate dates</li>
    <li>How many people</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The earlier the better.
    Details are shared privately.
